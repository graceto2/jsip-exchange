(** An order submitted to the exchange.

    A production exchange order would carry extensive metadata: client
    identifiers, regulatory flags, risk group assignment, execution
    instructions, and more. We keep orders simple: a participant wants to buy
    or sell some quantity of a symbol at a given price. *)

(** A request to submit an order, exactly as it travels on the wire.

    This mirrors the peer exchange's [Order.Request.t]. It carries no
    [participant]: identity comes from the authenticated session on the
    server, never from the client. The field order is fixed by the
    submit-order RPC's query digest and must not change. *)

(** Create a live order from a wire [request], the [participant] recovered
    from the authenticated session, and an assigned [order_id]. The
    [remaining_size] starts equal to the request's [size]. Raises if the
    request's [size] is non-positive. *)

(** {2 Mutation}

    The matching engine updates remaining size as fills occur. *)

    [remaining_size] or non-positive. *)
